# eco-design

Walk through sustainability considerations for an architecture or feature being planned. Unlike eco-review (which audits existing code), eco-design is forward-looking — it checks whether the design being discussed has considered greener alternatives at each decision point.

## Process

1. **Read project context** — the design doc, plan, or conversation so far
2. **Identify decision points** — which items from the checklist below are relevant to this design
3. **Present recommendations** — for each relevant decision point, present the eco-first alternative with its rationale and citation
4. **Discuss with developer** — ask whether they want to adopt each recommendation; accept pushback on compliance, latency, or cost constraints
5. **Summarize** — list accepted, declined, and deferred recommendations

## Decision Points Checklist

### Infrastructure Decisions

**Region selection**
If the design specifies a cloud region, look it up in the carbon intensity table below. If it's in the "High Carbon" tier, suggest a lower-carbon alternative in the same provider with comparable latency.
*Technical risk: Data residency/compliance violations, migration downtime, cross-region replication complexity.*
*Usability risk: Higher latency for users near original region.*
*Reference: I1 — Google Cloud Region Carbon Data, 2024*

**Compute model**
If the design uses always-on instances (EC2, GCE, VMs), check whether the workload is bursty or variable. If so, suggest serverless or spot/preemptible alternatives.
*Technical risk: Cold start latency (100ms–10s), state management complexity, execution time limits.*
*Usability risk: Noticeable delay on first request after idle period.*
*Reference: I3 — NRDC Data Center Efficiency Assessment; AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar*

**Container strategy**
If the design involves Docker containers, check the base image choice. Suggest alpine or distroless over full OS images. Suggest multi-stage builds if build tools would ship to production.
*Technical risk: Missing system libraries in minimal images, debugging difficulty without shell tools.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: I2 — Docker best practices*

**CI/CD configuration**
If CI/CD is part of the design, check for build caching and path-based filtering. Suggest both if not already planned.
*Technical risk: Stale cache causing flaky builds; path filters may miss cross-cutting changes.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: I4, I6 — GitHub Actions caching docs; GitLab CI rules documentation*

**Processor architecture**
If the design specifies x86 instances, check whether ARM-based alternatives exist (AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, GCP Axion). Most interpreted languages and containerized workloads run on ARM without modification.
*Technical risk: Native binary dependencies (compiled C extensions, some ML libraries) may lack ARM builds. Container images must be multi-arch or ARM-specific.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: I7 — ARM Newsroom; AWS Graviton documentation*

### Code and API Decisions

**Real-time communication**
If the design includes polling for updates, suggest SSE, WebSockets, or webhooks instead.
*Technical risk: WebSocket connection management, reconnection logic, firewall/proxy issues.*
*Usability risk: Missed updates if push connection drops silently.*
*Reference: C1 — GSF Green Software Patterns*

**Data format**
If the design involves high-volume internal service communication using JSON, suggest compact alternatives (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) for internal APIs.
*Technical risk: Schema versioning complexity, harder debugging (binary payloads not human-readable).*
*Usability risk: None (internal service change, not user-facing).*
*Reference: C6 — Google Developers Protocol Buffers documentation*

**Static asset delivery**
Check whether the design addresses:
- Compression (gzip/brotli) for all text resources (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, API responses) — *Technical risk: CPU overhead on high-throughput endpoints. Usability risk: None.* — *Reference: C2*
- Cache-control headers — *Technical risk: Stale content after deploys if cache-busting is wrong. Usability risk: Users see outdated content until cache expires.* — *Reference: C3*
- Image optimization (WebP/AVIF, srcset, lazy loading) — *Technical risk: Older browser incompatibility with WebP/AVIF. Usability risk: Quality degradation if compression too aggressive, layout shift from lazy loading.* — *Reference: C4*
- Font subsetting (subset to required character ranges, self-host for control) — *Technical risk: Missing characters for user-generated content in unexpected languages. Usability risk: Missing glyphs display as fallback font.* — *Reference: C9*
- Video optimization (MP4/WebM over GIF, preload attributes, adaptive bitrate) — *Technical risk: Adaptive bitrate adds infrastructure complexity. Usability risk: Replacing autoplay with click-to-play changes UX.* — *Reference: C10*
- CDN for static files — *Technical risk: Cache invalidation on deploy, CDN configuration drift. Usability risk: None.* — *Reference: A2*

**Frontend bundle strategy**
If the design involves a web frontend, check for tree-shaking, code splitting, dynamic imports, and dead code elimination. Audit for unused exports and over-inclusive library imports.
*Technical risk: Code splitting adds loading states, race conditions with shared dependencies. Removing seemingly dead code risks breaking dynamic references.*
*Usability risk: Visible spinners/flashes for lazy-loaded chunks on slow connections.*
*Reference: C5, C7 — webpack/Vite documentation; Web Almanac 2024*

**Third-party scripts**
If the design includes analytics, ads, social widgets, or other third-party scripts, check whether each is essential. Suggest performance budgets, deferred loading, and facade patterns for heavy embeds (e.g., YouTube, chat widgets).
*Technical risk: Removing analytics/tracking may break business reporting or A/B testing. Facade patterns require loading the real resource on interaction.*
*Usability risk: Removing social widgets or live chat reduces convenience for some users.*
*Reference: C8 — Web Almanac 2024; The Shift Project*

### Product Design Decisions

**Update delivery**
If the design includes notifications or real-time updates, suggest batched/digest mode as the default for non-urgent content, with real-time as an opt-in.
*Technical risk: Batch scheduling complexity, ensuring urgent items still deliver promptly.*
*Usability risk: Users miss time-sensitive updates when defaulted to digest mode.*
*Reference: P1 — GSF Green Software Patterns*

**Content loading**
If the design involves content feeds, suggest pagination or virtual scrolling over infinite scroll.
*Technical risk: Pagination state management, virtual scrolling library complexity.*
*Usability risk: Extra clicks to navigate pages, less fluid browsing experience.*
*Reference: P2 — Nielsen Norman Group research on scrolling behavior*

**Data lifecycle**
If the design stores user or transient data, suggest defining TTLs and archival policies from the start.
*Technical risk: Data migration complexity, backup coordination, accidental deletion of needed data.*
*Usability risk: Users lose data they expected to keep, compliance conflicts with retention requirements.*
*Reference: P3 — AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar*

**Background features**
If the design includes background sync, tracking, or analytics, suggest user-controllable toggles with battery-intensive features defaulting to off.
*Technical risk: Feature flag complexity, ensuring critical background tasks (e.g., data sync) still run.*
*Usability risk: Users forget to re-enable features, miss functionality they relied on unconsciously.*
*Reference: P4 — Android Developers battery optimization guides; Apple Energy Efficiency Guide*

### Architecture Decisions

**Processing model**
If the design processes tasks synchronously that could be deferred, suggest async job queues.
*Technical risk: Queue monitoring complexity, dead letter handling, eventual consistency issues.*
*Usability risk: Delayed feedback — users don't see results immediately for deferred tasks.*
*Reference: A1 — AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar*

**Static asset origin**
If static files are served from the origin server, suggest a CDN.
*Technical risk: Cache invalidation on deploy, CDN configuration drift, origin failover complexity.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: A2 — Cloudflare documentation*

**Job scheduling**
If the design uses cron-based scheduled jobs, suggest event-driven triggers where possible.
*Technical risk: Event ordering guarantees, idempotency requirements, harder to test than cron.*
*Usability risk: None (backend processing change, not user-facing).*
*Reference: A3 — GSF Green Software Patterns*

**Data storage**
If the same data is stored in multiple locations, suggest a single source of truth with caching/derived views.
*Technical risk: Single point of failure, cache coherence complexity, migration risk for existing consumers.*
*Usability risk: None (data layer change, not user-facing).*
*Reference: A4 — Industry consensus*

**Data access patterns**
If the design uses an ORM, check for an eager loading strategy for related records. Default ORM behavior (lazy loading) produces N+1 query patterns that scale poorly.
*Technical risk: Over-eager loading can fetch more data than needed, increasing memory usage. Complex eager loading can generate slow JOINs.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: A5 — PlanetScale blog; Azure Well-Architected Framework*

**Observability configuration**
If the design includes logging or monitoring, check log levels and retention policies. Suggest WARN or INFO for production, structured logging over full payload dumps, and 7-30 day retention for verbose logs.
*Technical risk: Reducing log verbosity may make production debugging harder for intermittent issues. Retention policies may discard logs needed for incident review.*
*Usability risk: None.*
*Reference: A6 — ClickHouse blog; Logz.io*

```

## Interaction Rules

- Only raise decision points relevant to the current design — don't ask about Docker if there are no containers
- Present recommendations conversationally, not as a wall of text
- Accept pushback gracefully — note compliance, latency, and cost constraints
- Always surface both risks when presenting a recommendation — this builds trust and helps developers make informed trade-offs
- Keep it concise — this adds to an existing planning flow, not a standalone session
